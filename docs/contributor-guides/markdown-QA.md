# Contributor Quality Assurance (QA) Guide

## Introduction
This guide explains how contributors to this repository should use **Vale** and **markdownlint-cli** to ensure that all Markdown files in this repository meet high-quality standards before being pushed to the default branch.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:
- [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/installation) (for linting and style checks)
- [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint-cli) (for Markdown formatting checks)

## Linting with Vale
Vale is a tool that checks Markdown files for style and grammar issues based on a set of predefined rules. To use Vale for linting Markdown files:

### Step 1: Install Vale
If you haven't already, you can install Vale by following the [installation instructions](https://vale.sh/docs/installation).

### Step 2: Running Vale
1. Clone the repository to your local machine (if you haven’t already done so).
2. Navigate to the root of the repository.
3. In your terminal, run the following command to lint all Markdown files:
   ```bash
   vale .

### Step 3: Review the Results
Vale will output any issues it finds in the Markdown files. These may include:
- Grammar and spelling errors
- Inconsistent writing style (e.g., inconsistent use of commas, capitalization)
- Suggestions for improving readability

### Step 4: Fix the Issues
Review the suggestions or errors provided by Vale. Make the necessary changes to the Markdown files based on these recommendations. Once all issues have been resolved, you can commit the changes.

## Linting with markdownlint-cli
markdownlint-cli checks the formatting of Markdown files to ensure they follow best practices. To use markdownlint-cli:

### Step 1: Install markdownlint-cli
If you haven't already, install markdownlint-cli globally by running:
npm install -g markdownlint-cli

### Step 2: Running markdownlint-cli
In your terminal, navigate to the root of the repository.
Run the following command to check all Markdown files in the repository:
markdownlint .

### Step 3: Review the Results
markdownlint-cli will output any formatting issues, such as:
Line length exceeding the limit (typically 80 characters)
Missing or extra spaces after headings or list items
Incorrect use of Markdown syntax (e.g., inconsistent use of list markers)

### Step 4: Fix the Issues
Review the results and fix any Markdown formatting issues. Follow the recommendations provided by markdownlint-cli to ensure the file adheres to the repository’s formatting standards.

## Commit and Push Changes
After fixing any issues flagged by Vale and markdownlint-cli, commit your changes and push them to your feature branch. Make sure that all changes pass the linting checks before pushing them.

### Step 1: Stage Your Changes
git add .

### Step 2: Commit Your Changes
git commit -m "Fix linting and formatting issues in markdown files"

### Step 3: Push Your Changes
